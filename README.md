## Inference: 
It shows scatterplots for each pair of numerical variables and histograms for each individual variable along the diagonal.By examining the scatterplots, we can observe any linear or non-linear relationships between variables. <br> For example, if there's a strong positive correlation between two variables, we would expect to see a clear upward trend in the corresponding scatterplot.

## Correlation matrix :

## Inference:
Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, where: <br>
1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, <br>
-1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, <br>
0 indicates no linear relationship. <br>
By examining the correlation matrix, we can identify variables that are strongly correlated (either positively or negatively) with each other. <br>
Strong correlations (close to 1 or -1) may indicate redundant information or multicollinearity, which can affect the performance of certain models.

## Inference:
The matrix is divided into four quadrants: True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN). <br>
From the confusion matrix, we can calculate various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
